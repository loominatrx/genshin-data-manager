# genshin-data-manager

This python script allows you to download and manage Genshin Impact's game data in your laptop (or even your Android phone if you have terminal working with root privileges)

## Prerequisities

- Any working device (Windows, Linux, or Android with terminal emulator; not sure with Mac)
- Python 3+ (tested on Python 3.10)
- android-platform-tools (adb)
- aria2c

Please do your own research on how to install those prerequisities, as I do not cover them in this README.

## How to use

- Clone this repository
    `git clone https://github.com/Loominagit/genshin-data-manager`
    or just download the source code from the website...
- `cd genshin-data-manager` and run `python3 main.py`. Don't forget to follow the instructions!

## FAQ

Q: How did you found out the server link?

A: I know I'll get this kind of question. The thing is, I accidentally revealed the server link from the download output that's generated by Genshin when a download error occurred.



Q: Why is the script so poorly written?

A: It's because I'm still bad at scripting in Python. If you want to improve the script's performance, you can make a good pull request, so I can merge it into the main repo!
